# multi-features-graph2Json
In this work is proposed a method to transform a single multi-feature graph in n JSON sub-graph objects, where are shown edges and attributes. At every iteration is added to the JSON sub-graph object a set of nodes presented in a single multi-feature graph shown all the edges of the sub-set of the nodes that composed the JSON sub-graph and the feature in the nodes, if there are more than a feature in the node, they will be mapped in a different JSON object with the edges.
